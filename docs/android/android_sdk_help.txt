$ android update sdk --no-ui

Action "update sdk":
  Updates the SDK by suggesting new platforms to install if available.
Options:
  -f --force    Forces replacement of a package or its parts, even if something has been modified
  -u --no-ui    Updates from command-line (does not display the GUI)
  -o --obsolete Installs obsolete packages
  -t --filter   A filter that limits the update to the specified types of packages in the form of
                a comma-separated list of [platform, tool, platform-tool, doc, sample, extra]
  -s --no-https Uses HTTP instead of HTTPS (the default) for downloads
  -n --dry-mode Simulates the update but does not download or install anything


If you want to list which packages are available for installation you can use

$ android list sdk

and you'll obtain an ordered list of packages, for example

Packages available for installation or update: 9
   1- ARM EABI v7a System Image, Android API 15, revision 2
   2- Intel x86 Atom System Image, Android API 15, revision 1
   3- Android Support, revision 8
   4- Google AdMob Ads SDK, revision 6
   5- Google Analytics SDK, revision 2
   6- Google Play APK Expansion Library, revision 1
   7- Google Play Billing Library, revision 2
   8- Google Play Licensing Library, revision 2
   9- Google Web Driver, revision 2

Also you can limit the update only to a desired component if you use the --filter option

$ android update sdk --filter <component> --no-ui

where component is one or more of

    the numbers returned by android list sdk (i.e. 1, also know as package index)
    add-on
    doc
    extra
    platform
    platform-tool
    sample
    source
    system-image
    tool

or can be one or more specific identifiers. For instance, if you just want to download a small set of specific packages, you could do this:

$ android update sdk -u --filter platform-tools,android-16,extra-android-support

and you'll just get the platform tools, api level 16 and support package jar. This is really handy if you're building a build machine only and would have to pay for downloading all the extra stuff that you'll never use.

To see the available options you can use --help, for example

$ android --help list sdk

       Usage:
       android [global options] list sdk [action options]
       Global options:
  -h --help       : Help on a specific command.
  -v --verbose    : Verbose mode, shows errors, warnings and all messages.
     --clear-cache: Clear the SDK Manager repository manifest cache.
  -s --silent     : Silent mode, shows errors only.

                   Action "list sdk":
  Lists remote SDK repository.
Options:
  -o --obsolete  : Deprecated. Please use --all instead.
  -a --all       : Lists all available packages (including obsolete and
                   installed ones)
     --proxy-host: HTTP/HTTPS proxy host (overrides settings if defined)
     --proxy-port: HTTP/HTTPS proxy port (overrides settings if defined)
  -s --no-https  : Uses HTTP instead of HTTPS (the default) for downloads.
  -e --extended  : Displays extended details on each package
  -u --no-ui     : Displays list result on console (no GUI) [Default: true]
